# This contents of the image block (<image>) are shared by all the lessons.
#
# Each lesson imports this block into its configuration file using
#
# <<include ../etc/image.conf>>
#
# The path is relative to your current directory, therefore
# in order for workstation/2/1/../../etc/image.conf to be correctly included,
# you must invoke circos from the lesson directory. 
# For example, for section 2 lesson 1
#
# > cd workstation/2/1
# > circos -conf etc/circos.conf
#
